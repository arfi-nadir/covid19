# Data visualization project

The main purpose of this project is learning how to fetch a huge amount of data from an API and
render it on a single web application (SPA) by using React JS as a main front-end library.
The API provides data in JSON which is a lightweight data exchange format written in Javascript.
API: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api

Material UI is used for styling UI components such as forms, cards.
ChartJS is responsible of making the visualization charts.
